Mitch I love you but this is 100% true. Time is running out. Get tough and move quickly or it will be too late. The Dems are vicious but got caught. They MUST pay a big price for what they have done to our Country. Don't let them get away with this! @LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/PplfqTJdHc

No reason to turn it down except politics. We have plenty of testing. Maybe you need a new Doctor over there. Crazy Nancy will use it as an excuse not to show up to work! https://t.co/NucH4dbKBL

The Democrats are just as always looking for trouble. They do nothing constructive even in times of crisis. They don't want to blame their cash cow China for the plague. China is blaming Europe. Dr. Fauci will be testifying before the Senate very soon! #DONOTHINGDEMOCRATS https://t.co/fgHuYeiOQY

Concast (@NBCNews) and Fake News @CNN are going out of their way to say GREAT things about China. They are Chinese puppets who want to do business there. They use USA airwaves to help China. The Enemy of the People!

The Governor of Michigan should give a little and put out the fire. These are very good people but they are angry. They want their lives back again safely! See them talk to them make a deal.
%
Cryin Chuck Schumer compared to what other Senators have brought home to their states has brought very little back to N.Y. A totally overrated loser the one thing he has given them is SALT. He never even called me to stop it. No wonder Cuomo &amp; most others can't stand him. AOC!
%
Cryin' Chuck Schumer was on a late night show using a false talking point over &amp; over again. "We don't have enough testing " he would repeat when he knows we have done a great job on Testing just like we have on Ventilators and everything else. He lied gave NY SALT. Run AOC!

FAKE POLLING just like 2016 (but worse)!
%
What happened to General Michael Flynn a war hero should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the United States again!
%
Does anybody really believe that Roger Stone a man whose house was raided early in the morning by 29 gun toting FBI Agents (with Fake News @CNN closely in toe) was treated fairly. How about the jury forewoman with her unannounced hatred &amp; bias. Same scammers as General Flynn!
%
Despite reports to the contrary Sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown. As of today 2462 people have died there a much higher number than the neighboring countries of Norway (207) Finland (206) or Denmark (443). The United States made the correct decision!
%
Lyin' Brian Williams of MSDNC! https://t.co/3gtkdmoZjJ
%
I must admit that Lyin' Brian Williams is while dumber than hell quite a bit smarter than Fake News @CNN "anchorman" Don Lemon the "dumbest man on television". Then you have Psycho Joe "What Ever Happened To Your Girlfriend?" Scarborough another of the low I.Q. individuals!
%
Lyin' Brian Williams of MSDNC a Concast Scam Company wouldn't know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead. Remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter? Totally made up story. He's a true dummy who was thrown off Network News like a dog. Stay tuned!
%
Just told that Fake News @CNN is falsely reporting that I was recently shouting at my campaign manager over made up nonsense. Actually he is doing a great job I never shouted at him (been with me for years including the 2016 win) &amp; have no intention to do so. Just FAKE NEWS!
%
.@CNN doesn't want to speak about their persecution of General Michael Flynn &amp; why they got the story so wrong. They along with others should pay a big price for what they have purposely done to this man &amp; his family. They won't even cover the big breaking news about this scam!
%
Happy Birthday to three time Olympian and five term Congressman @JimRyun!

The only reason the U.S. has reported one million cases of CoronaVirus is that our Testing is sooo much better than any other country in the World. Other countries are way behind us in Testing and therefore show far fewer cases!

We are doing far more and better Testing than any other country in the world and yet the media does nothing but complain. No matter how good a job is done the same as with the Ventilators they will never say we are doing a great job they will only viciously gripe!

Why should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois as example) and cities in all cases Democrat run and managed when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help? I am open to discussing anything but just asking?
%
FAKE NEWS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
%
There has never been in the history of our Country a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now even in the midst of a National Emergency the Invisible Enemy!
%
Blame the Democrats for any "lateness" in your Enhanced Unemployment Insurance. I wanted the money to be paid directly they insisted it be paid by states for distribution. I told them this would happen especially with many states which have old computers.

Does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called Noble (not Nobel) Prize is especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists? Noble is defined as "having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals." Does sarcasm ever work?
%
Reports that H.H.S. Secretary @AlexAzar is going to be "fired" by me are Fake News. The Lamestream Media knows this but they are desperate to create the perception of chaos &amp; havoc in the minds of the public. They never even called to ask. Alex is doing an excellent job!
%
....fraud @donnabrazile (and others who are even worse). Chris Wallace is nastier to Republicans than even Deface the Nation or Sleepy Eyes. The people who are watching @FoxNews in record numbers (thank you President Trump) are angry. They want an alternative now. So do I!
%
....Even the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats laughed at the Fox suggestion. No respect for the people running @FoxNews. But Fox keeps on plugging to try and become politically correct. They put RINO Paul Ryan on their Board. They hire "debate questions to Crooked Hillary"....
%
.@FoxNews just doesn't get what's happening! They are being fed Democrat talking points and they play them without hesitation or research. They forgot that Fake News @CNN &amp; MSDNC wouldn't let @FoxNews participate even a little bit in the poor ratings Democrat Debates.....
%
....Lawsuits should be brought against all including the Fake News Organizations to rectify this terrible injustice. For all of the great lawyers out there do we have any takers? When will the Noble Committee Act? Better be fast!
%
....to the REAL REPORTERS &amp; JOURNALISTS who got it right. I can give the Committee a very comprehensive list. When will the Noble Committee DEMAND the Prizes back especially since they were gotten under fraud? The reporters and Lamestream Media knew the truth all along....
%
When will all of the "reporters" who have received Noble Prizes for their work on Russia Russia Russia only to have been proven totally wrong (and in fact it was the other side who committed the crimes) be turning back their cherished "Nobles" so that they can be given....

%
I work from early in the morning until late at night haven't left the White House in many months (except to launch Hospital Ship Comfort) in order to take care of Trade Deals Military Rebuilding etc. and then I read a phony story in the failing @nytimes about my work....
%
The people that know me and know the history of our Country say that I am  the hardest working President in history. I don't know about that but I am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any President in history. The Fake News hates it!

I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing? I said that the Do Nothing Democrats together with their Mainstream Media partners are the Hoax. They have been called out &amp; embarrassed on this even admitting they were wrong but continue to spread the lie!
%
Remember the Cure can't be worse than the problem itself. Be careful be safe use common sense!
%
What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions &amp; then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. They get record ratings &amp; the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time &amp; effort!
%
Was just informed that the Fake News from the Thursday White House Press Conference had me speaking &amp; asking questions of Dr. Deborah Birx. Wrong I was speaking to our Laboratory expert not Deborah about sunlight etc. &amp; the CoronaVirus. The Lamestream Media is corrupt &amp; sick!
%
If the Wall Street Journal "Editorial" writers had called as they should have they would have easily found that I was "NOT happy with the Georgia Governor on Tuesday night." You said the opposite and got it wrong as you often do!
%
The Do Nothing Democrats are spending much of their money on Fake Ads. I never said that the CoronaVirus is a "Hoax" I said that the Democrats and the way they lied about it are a Hoax. Also it did start with "one person from China" and then grew &amp; will be a "Miracle" end!
%
We have now Tested more than 5 Million People. That is more than any other country in the World and even more than  all major countries combined!
%
It is a wonderful feeling to know that our States are loaded up with Ventilators many brand new and high quality just off of our production lines and that we are now in a position to help other countries that so desperately need them. Every person needing a Ventilator got one!
%
Just spoke to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali of Ethiopia. His Country needs Ventilators and the U.S. is in good position to help him. We will!
%
Many testing sites are and have been open &amp; available. Just passed 5 Million Tests far more than any other country in the world. In fact more than all other major countries combined! Don't believe the Fake News! https://t.co/uTSMAvj7R3

I (or @VP) never gave Governor Brian Kemp an OK on those few businesses outside of the Guidelines. FAKE NEWS! Spas beauty salons tattoo parlors &amp; barber shops should take a little slower path but I told the Governor to do what is right for the great people of Georgia (&amp; USA)!

The most often used phrase in the Lamestream Media by far is "sources say" or "officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity" or anything similar which allows Fake News to make up a phony quote from a person who doesn't even exist. The American people should demand NAMES!

....them happy or even a little bit satisfied. They were RUDE and NASTY. This is their political playbook and they will use it right up to the election on November 3rd. They will not change because they feel that this is the only way they can win. America will not be fooled!!!
%
....Example! V.P. Mike Pence held a conference call yesterday with all Democrat Senators. He gave them everything that they would have wanted to hear in terms of gaining ground on the CoronaVirus but nothing that anyone could have said including "it's over" could have made....
%
No matter what you do for the Do Nothing Democrats no matter how GREAT a job you are doing they will only respond to their Fake partners in the Lamestream Media in the negative even in a time of crisis. I thought it would be different but it's not. In fact it's even worse...

China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S. not even close!

Biden/Obama were a disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu. Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers. 17000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence! Also don't forget their 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website that should have cost close to nothing!

The Opposition Party (Lamestream Media) and their partner the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats have put their political game plan in full swing. "Whether he is right or wrong it doesn't matter. Criticize 'Trump' for everything and don't let the public see Biden. Hide him."

If the Fake News Opposition Party is pushing with all their might the fact that President Trump "ignored early warnings about the threat" then why did Media &amp; Dems viciously criticize me when I instituted a Travel Ban on China? They said "early &amp; not necessary." Corrupt Media!

I will be having a news conference today at 3:00 P.M. The White House. Topic: CoronaVirus!
%
To this point and because we have had a very strong border policy we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders that number would be many times higher!
%
The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks. Jay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic &amp; physiological disadvantage. Should never have been this way. Also STIMULATE!
%
If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly &amp; efficiently let them have the full money that they earned APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!

.... Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster with thousands dying and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut ready to go!
%
For decades the @CDCgov looked at and studied  its testing system but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic but a pandemic would never happen they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further.....

"The Obama White House had to immediately issue an apology for Joe Biden's remarks and any alarm that he might have caused an alarm about a Swine Flu outbreak that took 6 months for President Obama to declare a National Emergency and that killed 12000 Americans." @LouDobbs

Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best with fast action of border closings &amp; a 78% Approval Rating the highest on record. His was lowest!

Hoping to get the payroll tax cut approved by both Republicans and Democrats and please remember very important for all countries &amp; businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.

So selfish for Elizabeth Warren to stay in the race. She has Zero chance of even coming close to winning but hurts Bernie badly. So much for their wonderful liberal friendship. Will he ever speak to her again? She cost him Massachusetts (and came in third) he shouldn't!

The Democrat establishment came together and crushed Bernie Sanders AGAIN! Even the fact that Elizabeth Warren stayed in the race was devastating to Bernie and allowed Sleepy Joe to unthinkably win Massachusetts. It was a perfect storm with many good states remaining for Joe!

I would find it hard to believe that failed presidential candidates Tom Steyer or Mini Mike Bloombeg would contribute to the Democrat Party even against me after the way they have been treated - laughed at &amp; mocked. The real politicians ate them up and spit them out!

Word is that Mini Mike Bloomberg performed so poorly in the two debates that he is thinking about dropping out of the Democrat Primary. The fact is he was not true to himself and the public was able to quickly figure him out. Not a good experience for Mini Mike!

Thank you to @mirandadevine of the New York Post for your interesting (and correct) column today. "Trump has gained 20 points since Impeachment began in October. He gets 67% on economy. Nonwhite approval of Trump is also at a high: 28% up 10 points in a year. Nice one Nancy."

Hope the Fake News which never discusses it is talking about the big crowds forming for my New Hampshire Rally tonight. They won't!
%
Because of how badly they did with the Impeachment Hoax AOC will primary Cryin' Chuck Schumer and win and Jerry Nadler has a good chance of losing to his far left primary opponent! It is all getting quite interesting. Pelosi will lose the House AGAIN! My poll numbers great.
%
95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party a Record! 53% overall (plus add 9 points?). Corrupt Democrat politicians have brought me to highest polling numbers ever with the Impeachment Hoax. Thank you Nancy!

Will be in Manchester New Hampshire tonight for a big Rally. Want to shake up the Dems a little bit - they have a really boring deal going on. Still waiting for the Iowa results votes were fried. Big crowds in Manchester!

....This is the biggest political crime in American History by far. SIMPLY PUT THE PARTY IN POWER ILLEGALLY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTION IN ORDER TO CHANGE OR NULLIFY THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. IT CONTINUED ON WITH THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX. Terrible!

FBI Director Christopher Wray just admitted that the FISA Warrants and Survailence of my campaign were illegal. So was the Fake Dossier. THEREFORE THE WHOLE SCAM INVESTIGATION THE MUELLER REPORT AND EVERYTHING ELSE FOR THREE YEARS WAS A FIXED HOAX. WHO PAYS THE PRICE?....

So good to see that Republicans will be winning the Great State of Alabama Senate Seat back now that lightweight Senator @DougJones cast a partisan vote for the Impeachment Hoax. Thought his boss Cryin' Chuck would have forced him to vote against the Hoax. A Do Nothing Stiff!

Can't say I mind the fact that the great people of West Virginia are furious at their puppet Democrat Senator Joe Manchin. They will never forget his phony vote on the Impeachment Hoax. All he had to do is read the Transcripts sadly which he wouldn't understand anyway.....

Crazy Nancy Pelosi's Impeachment Hoax has lifted Republican Congressional Polls (she lost the House once before!) and my Polls WAY UP which was expected but it has had a great effect on Republican Senate races including North Carolina Kentucky Colorado and Arizona. Thanks!

Mini Mike is now negotiating both to get on the Democrat Primary debate stage and to have the right to stand on boxes or a lift during the debates. This is sometimes done but really not fair!
%
Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere just wasting his money but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie something they wouldn't do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again 2016.

Mini Mike is part of the Fake News. They are all working together. In fact Bloomberg isn't covering himself (too boring to do) or other Dems. Only Trump. That sounds fair! It's all the Fake News Media and that's why nobody believes in them any more.
%
The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats don't want justice when pushing the Impeachment Hoax they only want to destabilize the Republican Party so they can do better in the 2020 election &amp; that includes the House &amp; Senate. They are playing with the people by taking it this far!

The noble people of Iran--who love America--deserve a government that's more interested in helping them achieve their dreams than killing them for demanding respect. Instead of leading Iran toward ruin its leaders should abandon terror and Make Iran Great Again! https://t.co/RLjGsC5WLc
%
The so-called "Supreme Leader" of Iran who has not been so Supreme lately had some nasty things to say about the United States and Europe. Their economy is crashing and their people are suffering. He should be very careful with his words!

Your 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia. That's what happens when you vote for Democrats they will take your guns away. Republicans will win Virginia in 2020. Thank you Dems!

....Joe Biden and Bernie is shut out again. Very unfair but that's the way the Democrats play the game. Anyway it's a lot of fun to watch!
%
They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders just like last time only even more obviously. They are bringing him out of so important Iowa in order that as a Senator he sit through the Impeachment Hoax Trial. Crazy Nancy thereby gives the strong edge to Sleepy...

Getting ready to meet the LSU Tigers the National Champions. Great Coach great Team great School. Very exciting!

Mini Mike Bloomberg ads are purposely wrong - A vanity project for him to get into the game. Nobody in many years has done for the USA what I have done for the USA including the greatest economy in history rebuilding our military biggest ever tax &amp; regulation cuts &amp; 2nd A!
%
Mini Mike Bloomberg doesn't get on the Democrat Debate Stage because he doesn't want to - he is a terrible debater and speaker. If he did he would go down in the polls even more (if that is possible!).

The farmers are really happy with the new China Trade Deal and the soon to be signed deal with Mexico and Canada but I hope the thing they will most remember is the fact that I was able to take massive incoming Tariff money and use it to help them get through the tough times!

Cryin' Chuck Schumer is saying privately that the new China Trade Deal is  unbelievable which it is but publicly he knocks it whenever possible. That's politics but so bad for our great Country!
%
One of the greatest trade deals ever made! Also good for China and our long term relationship. 250 Billion Dollars will be coming back to our Country and we are now in a great position for a Phase Two start. There has never been anything like this in U.S. history! USMCA NEXT!

Here we go again another Con Job by the Do Nothing Democrats. All of this work was supposed to be done by the House not the Senate!

Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background &amp; from every race religion color &amp; creed.

Cryin' Chuck Schumer just said "The American people want a fair trial in the Senate." True but why didn't Nervous Nancy and Corrupt politician Adam "Shifty" Schiff give us a fair trial in the House. It was the most lopsided &amp; unfair basement hearing in the history of Congress!

We are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers drug dealers  and other violent criminal elements. They will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country NOW! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

I stand stronger than anyone in protecting your Healthcare with Pre-Existing Conditions. I am honored to have terminated the very unfair costly and unpopular individual mandate for you!
%
"We demand fairness" shouts Pelosi and the Do Nothing Democrats yet the Dems in the House wouldn't let us have 1 witness no lawyers or even ask questions. It was the most unfair witch-hunt in the history of Congress!

Really Big Breaking News (Kidding): Booker who was in zero polling territory just dropped out of the Democrat Presidential Primary Race. Now I can rest easy tonight. I was sooo concerned that I would someday have to go head to head with him!
%
The Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist Soleimani was "imminent" or not &amp; was my team in agreement. The answer to both is a strong YES. but it doesn't really matter because of his horrible past!
%
Wow! The wonderful Iranian protesters refused to step on or in any way denigrate our Great American Flag. It was put on the street in order for them to trample it and they walked around it instead. Big progress!
%
The Democrats and the Fake News are trying to make terrorist Soleimani into a wonderful guy only because I did what should have been done for 20 years. Anything I do whether it's the economy military or anything else will be scorned by the Rafical Left Do Nothing Democrats!

Bernie Sander's volunteers are trashing Elizabeth "Pocahontus" Warren. Everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters. Mini Mike B is also trying but getting tiny crowds which are all leaving fast. Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?
%
....and if Republicans win in court and take back the House of Represenatives your healthcare that I have now brought to the best place in many years will become the best ever by far. I will always protect your Pre-Existing Conditions the Dems will not!

Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising. I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare you have it now while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive unfair and very unpopular Individual  Mandate.....

National Security Adviser suggested today that sanctions &amp; protests have Iran "choked off" will force them to negotiate. Actually I couldn't care less if they negotiate. Will be totally up to them but no nuclear weapons and "don't kill your protesters."

Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence no crime read the transcripts "no pressure"  Impeachment Hoax rather than an outright dismissal it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have. I agree!

I keep reading Fake News stories that my campaign is running low on money. Not true, &amp; if it were so, I would put up money myself. The fact is that we have much more money than we had 4 years ago, where we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary, and still easily won, 306-223!,

Joe Biden just announced that he will not agree to a Drug Test. Gee, I wonder why?,
%
.....Financial Statements, from  the time I announced I was going to run for President,  showing all properties, assets and debts. It is a very IMPRESSIVE Statement, and also shows that I am the only President on record to give up my yearly $400,000 plus Presidential Salary!,
%
.....Also, if you look at the extraordinary assets owned by me, which the Fake News hasn't, I am extremely under leveraged - I have very little debt compared to the value of assets. Much of this information is already on file, but I have long said that I may release....,
%
The Fake News Media, just like Election time 2016, is bringing up my Taxes &amp; all sorts of other nonsense with illegally obtained information &amp; only bad intent. I paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled, like everyone else, to depreciation &amp; tax credits.....,

The Radical Left Mayors &amp;  Governors of Cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their "Movement". It wasn't supposed to be like this, but the Anarchists &amp; Agitators got carried away and don't listen anymore - even forced Slow Joe out of basement!,

80 Million Unsolicited Ballots are impossible for election centers to tabulate accurately. The Democrats know this better than anyone else. The fraud and abuse will be an embarrassment to our Country. Hopefully the Courts will stop this scam!,

For our Country to be sending 80 million UNSOLICITED BALLOTS is very unfair and a roadmap to disaster. Even recent small and easier to control elections which did this are a catastrophic disaster. Fraudulent &amp; missing Ballots like never seen before. 20% and 30% off. STOP!,

These riots are an antigovernment movement from the Left that are all in Democrat run cities. The mayors have got to let their police do what they know how to do. Would be very easy to suppress or, call in the Federal Government. We will solve problem fast! @foxandfriends,
%
So now the Democrats are using Mail Drop Boxes, which are a voter security disaster. Among other things, they make it possible for a person to vote multiple times. Also, who controls them, are they placed in Republican or Democrat areas? They are not Covid sanitized. A big fraud!,

%
Representatives of the Post Office have repeatedly stated that they DO NOT NEED MONEY, and will not make changes. This is all another HOAX by the Democrats to give 25 Billion unneeded dollars for political purposes,  without talking about the Universal Mail-In Ballot Scam....,

The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives! @SteveFDA,
%
Why would Suburban Women vote for Biden and the Democrats when Democrat run cities are now rampant with crime (and they aren't asking the Federal Government for help) which could easily spread to the suburbs, and they will reconstitute, on steroids, their low income suburbs plan!,
%
Biden and the Democrats have greatly disrespected the Great State of Wisconsin by not even paying a small visit to Milwaukee, the designated site of the DNC. The State &amp; City worked very hard to make sure things would be good. Not nice. Vote Trump Wisconsin!,
%
The Democrats took the word GOD out of the Pledge of Allegiance at the Democrat National Convention. At first I thought they made a mistake, but it wasn't. It was done on purpose. Remember Evangelical Christians, and ALL, this is where they are coming from-it's done. Vote Nov 3!,
%
Another bad night of Rioting in Portland, Oregon. A small number of Federal troops there to protect courthouse and other Federal property only (great job!). Wanting to be asked by City &amp; State to STOP THE RIOTS. Would bring in National Guard, end problem immediately. ASK!,

%
They are sending out 51,000,000 Ballots to people who haven't even requested a Ballot. Many of those people don't even exist. They are trying to STEAL this election. This should not be allowed!,
%
The Democrats are demanding Mail-In Ballots because the enthusiasm meter for Slow Joe Biden is the lowest in recorded history, and they are concerned that very few people will turn out to vote. Instead, they will search &amp; find people, then "harvest" &amp; return Ballots. Not fair!,

Very sadly for our Nation, it looks like Senator @JimInhofe will not be putting the Section 230 termination clause into the Defense Bill. So bad for our National Security and Election Integrity. Last chance to ever get it done. I will VETO!,

The best way to insure a @KLoeffler and @sendavidperdue VICTORY is to allow signature checks in the Presidential race, which will insure a Georgia Presidential win (very few votes are needed, many will be found). Spirits will soar and everyone will rush out and VOTE! @BrianKempGA,

Biden will terminate school choice, eliminate charter schools, defund religious schools, ban prayer in public schools, indoctrinate your children with Anti-American lies, and force you to subsidize extreme late-term abortion. We believe that every child is a Sacred Gift from God!,

For decades, Joe Biden let other countries rip you off and cheat America blind! The only people who've benefited from his policies are himself &amp; his family. He shows up every 4 years, and then goes back to D.C. and caters to his special interests. My only special interest is YOU.,

Wow. Today's @nypost story on Joe Biden's corruption is a monster. Many witnesses to a crime against our Country. This isn't going away. Even the Lamestream Media is starting to say it must be covered!,

Biden wants to Pack the Court with Radical Left crazies. He doesn't even want to make a list to explain who they are. Can't let this happen!,

Finally! Suburban women are flocking over to us. They realize that I am saving the Suburbs - the American Dream! I terminated the Regulation that would bring projects and crime to Suburbia. Not on my watch! Biden will bring the Regulation back, but bigger and worse.,

Hunter Biden's laptop is a disaster for the entire Biden family, but especially for his father, Joe. It is now a proven fact, and cannot be denied, that all of that info is the REAL DEAL. That makes it impossible for "50%, or 10%" Joe, to ever assume the office of the President!,

Senator Little Ben Sasse of the Great State of Nebraska seems to be heading down the same inglorious path as former Senators Liddle' Bob Corker, whose approval rating in Tennessee went from 55% to 4%, &amp; Jeff "the Flake" Flake, whose approval rating in Arizona went from 56% to....,
%
...Nomination to run for a second term. Then he went back to his rather stupid and obnoxious ways. Must feel he can't lose to a Dem. Little Ben is a liability to the Republican Party, and an embarrassment to the Great State of Nebraska. Other than that, he's just a wonderful guy!,
%
The least effective of our 53 Republican Senators, and a person who truly doesn't have what it takes to be great, is Little Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a State which I have gladly done so much to help. @SenSasse was as nice as a RINO can be until he recently won the Republican....,
