trump tweet fortune file


This is a string file consisting of President Donald Trump's tweets, excluding re-tweets. The data was obtained from the <a href="http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/">Trump Twitter Archive.</a>
<p>I downloaded the data and with a bit of sed and awk magic I converted it into a file appropriate for use in the Unix program "fortune." The fortune program is frequently included in Unix distributions and available as a package for most others. <p>
 <p>To use this file with fortune you will need to use a program called strfile that is frequently included in Unix distributions and available as a package for most others. Usage would be "strfile trumpFortunes" to create the file that fortune will use to generate random fortunes.
