Mitch I love you but this is 100% true. Time is running out. Get tough and move quickly or it will be too late. The Dems are vicious but got caught. They MUST pay a big price for what they have done to our Country. Don’t let them get away with this! @LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/PplfqTJdHc

No reason to turn it down except politics. We have plenty of testing. Maybe you need a new Doctor over there. Crazy Nancy will use it as an excuse not to show up to work! https://t.co/NucH4dbKBL

The Democrats are just as always looking for trouble. They do nothing constructive even in times of crisis. They don’t want to blame their cash cow China for the plague. China is blaming Europe. Dr. Fauci will be testifying before the Senate very soon! #DONOTHINGDEMOCRATS https://t.co/fgHuYeiOQY

Concast (@NBCNews) and Fake News @CNN are going out of their way to say GREAT things about China. They are Chinese puppets who want to do business there. They use USA airwaves to help China. The Enemy of the People!

The Governor of Michigan should give a little and put out the fire. These are very good people but they are angry. They want their lives back again safely! See them talk to them make a deal.
%
Cryin Chuck Schumer compared to what other Senators have brought home to their states has brought very little back to N.Y. A totally overrated loser the one thing he has given them is SALT. He never even called me to stop it. No wonder Cuomo &amp; most others can’t stand him. AOC!
%
Cryin’ Chuck Schumer was on a late night show using a false talking point over &amp; over again. “We don’t have enough testing ” he would repeat when he knows we have done a great job on Testing just like we have on Ventilators and everything else. He lied gave NY SALT. Run AOC!

FAKE POLLING just like 2016 (but worse)!
%
What happened to General Michael Flynn a war hero should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the United States again!
%
Does anybody really believe that Roger Stone a man whose house was raided early in the morning by 29 gun toting FBI Agents (with Fake News @CNN closely in toe) was treated fairly. How about the jury forewoman with her unannounced hatred &amp; bias. Same scammers as General Flynn!
%
Despite reports to the contrary Sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown. As of today 2462 people have died there a much higher number than the neighboring countries of Norway (207) Finland (206) or Denmark (443). The United States made the correct decision!
%
Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC! https://t.co/3gtkdmoZjJ
%
I must admit that Lyin’ Brian Williams is while dumber than hell quite a bit smarter than Fake News @CNN “anchorman” Don Lemon the “dumbest man on television”. Then you have Psycho Joe “What Ever Happened To Your Girlfriend?” Scarborough another of the low I.Q. individuals!
%
Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC a Concast Scam Company wouldn’t know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead. Remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter? Totally made up story. He’s a true dummy who was thrown off Network News like a dog. Stay tuned!
%
Just told that Fake News @CNN is falsely reporting that I was recently shouting at my campaign manager over made up nonsense. Actually he is doing a great job I never shouted at him (been with me for years including the 2016 win) &amp; have no intention to do so. Just FAKE NEWS!
%
.@CNN doesn’t want to speak about their persecution of General Michael Flynn &amp; why they got the story so wrong. They along with others should pay a big price for what they have purposely done to this man &amp; his family. They won’t even cover the big breaking news about this scam!
%
Happy Birthday to three time Olympian and five term Congressman @JimRyun!

The only reason the U.S. has reported one million cases of CoronaVirus is that our Testing is sooo much better than any other country in the World. Other countries are way behind us in Testing and therefore show far fewer cases!

We are doing far more and better Testing than any other country in the world and yet the media does nothing but complain. No matter how good a job is done the same as with the Ventilators they will never say we are doing a great job they will only viciously gripe!

Why should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois as example) and cities in all cases Democrat run and managed when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help? I am open to discussing anything but just asking?
%
FAKE NEWS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
%
There has never been in the history of our Country a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now even in the midst of a National Emergency the Invisible Enemy!
%
Blame the Democrats for any “lateness” in your Enhanced Unemployment Insurance. I wanted the money to be paid directly they insisted it be paid by states for distribution. I told them this would happen especially with many states which have old computers.

Does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called Noble (not Nobel) Prize is especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists? Noble is defined as “having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals.” Does sarcasm ever work?
%
Reports that H.H.S. Secretary @AlexAzar is going to be “fired” by me are Fake News. The Lamestream Media knows this but they are desperate to create the perception of chaos &amp; havoc in the minds of the public. They never even called to ask. Alex is doing an excellent job!
%
....fraud @donnabrazile (and others who are even worse). Chris Wallace is nastier to Republicans than even Deface the Nation or Sleepy Eyes. The people who are watching @FoxNews in record numbers (thank you President Trump) are angry. They want an alternative now. So do I!
%
....Even the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats laughed at the Fox suggestion. No respect for the people running @FoxNews. But Fox keeps on plugging to try and become politically correct. They put RINO Paul Ryan on their Board. They hire “debate questions to Crooked Hillary”....
%
.@FoxNews just doesn’t get what’s happening! They are being fed Democrat talking points and they play them without hesitation or research. They forgot that Fake News @CNN &amp; MSDNC wouldn’t let @FoxNews participate even a little bit in the poor ratings Democrat Debates.....
%
....Lawsuits should be brought against all including the Fake News Organizations to rectify this terrible injustice. For all of the great lawyers out there do we have any takers? When will the Noble Committee Act? Better be fast!
%
....to the REAL REPORTERS &amp; JOURNALISTS who got it right. I can give the Committee a very comprehensive list. When will the Noble Committee DEMAND the Prizes back especially since they were gotten under fraud? The reporters and Lamestream Media knew the truth all along....
%
When will all of the “reporters” who have received Noble Prizes for their work on Russia Russia Russia only to have been proven totally wrong (and in fact it was the other side who committed the crimes) be turning back their cherished “Nobles” so that they can be given....

I work from early in the morning until late at night haven’t left the White House in many months (except to launch Hospital Ship Comfort) in order to take care of Trade Deals Military Rebuilding etc. and then I read a phony story in the failing @nytimes about my work....
%
The people that know me and know the history of our Country say that I am  the hardest working President in history. I don’t know about that but I am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any President in history. The Fake News hates it!

I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing? I said that the Do Nothing Democrats together with their Mainstream Media partners are the Hoax. They have been called out &amp; embarrassed on this even admitting they were wrong but continue to spread the lie!
%
Remember the Cure can’t be worse than the problem itself. Be careful be safe use common sense!
%
What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions &amp; then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. They get record ratings &amp; the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time &amp; effort!
%
Was just informed that the Fake News from the Thursday White House Press Conference had me speaking &amp; asking questions of Dr. Deborah Birx. Wrong I was speaking to our Laboratory expert not Deborah about sunlight etc. &amp; the CoronaVirus. The Lamestream Media is corrupt &amp; sick!
%
If the Wall Street Journal “Editorial” writers had called as they should have they would have easily found that I was “NOT happy with the Georgia Governor on Tuesday night.” You said the opposite and got it wrong as you often do!
%
The Do Nothing Democrats are spending much of their money on Fake Ads. I never said that the CoronaVirus is a “Hoax” I said that the Democrats and the way they lied about it are a Hoax. Also it did start with “one person from China” and then grew &amp; will be a “Miracle” end!
%
We have now Tested more than 5 Million People. That is more than any other country in the World and even more than  all major countries combined!
%
It is a wonderful feeling to know that our States are loaded up with Ventilators many brand new and high quality just off of our production lines and that we are now in a position to help other countries that so desperately need them. Every person needing a Ventilator got one!
%
Just spoke to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali of Ethiopia. His Country needs Ventilators and the U.S. is in good position to help him. We will!
%
Many testing sites are and have been open &amp; available. Just passed 5 Million Tests far more than any other country in the world. In fact more than all other major countries combined! Don’t believe the Fake News! https://t.co/uTSMAvj7R3

The most often used phrase in the Lamestream Media by far is “sources say” or “officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity” or anything similar which allows Fake News to make up a phony quote from a person who doesn’t even exist. The American people should demand NAMES!

....them happy or even a little bit satisfied. They were RUDE and NASTY. This is their political playbook and they will use it right up to the election on November 3rd. They will not change because they feel that this is the only way they can win. America will not be fooled!!!
%
....Example! V.P. Mike Pence held a conference call yesterday with all Democrat Senators. He gave them everything that they would have wanted to hear in terms of gaining ground on the CoronaVirus but nothing that anyone could have said including “it’s over” could have made....
%
No matter what you do for the Do Nothing Democrats no matter how GREAT a job you are doing they will only respond to their Fake partners in the Lamestream Media in the negative even in a time of crisis. I thought it would be different but it’s not. In fact it’s even worse...

China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S. not even close!

Biden/Obama were a disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu. Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers. 17000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence! Also don’t forget their 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website that should have cost close to nothing!

The Opposition Party (Lamestream Media) and their partner the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats have put their political game plan in full swing. “Whether he is right or wrong it doesn’t matter. Criticize ’Trump’ for everything and don’t let the public see Biden. Hide him.”

If the Fake News Opposition Party is pushing with all their might the fact that President Trump “ignored early warnings about the threat” then why did Media &amp; Dems viciously criticize me when I instituted a Travel Ban on China? They said “early &amp; not necessary.” Corrupt Media!

I will be having a news conference today at 3:00 P.M. The White House. Topic: CoronaVirus!
%
To this point and because we have had a very strong border policy we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders that number would be many times higher!
%
The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks. Jay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic &amp; physiological disadvantage. Should never have been this way. Also STIMULATE!
%
If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly &amp; efficiently let them have the full money that they earned APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!

.... Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster with thousands dying and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut ready to go!
%
For decades the @CDCgov looked at and studied  its testing system but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic but a pandemic would never happen they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further.....
%
“The Obama White House had to immediately issue an apology for Joe Biden’s remarks and any alarm that he might have caused an alarm about a Swine Flu outbreak that took 6 months for President Obama to declare a National Emergency and that killed 12000 Americans.” @LouDobbs

Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best with fast action of border closings &amp; a 78% Approval Rating the highest on record. His was lowest!

Hoping to get the payroll tax cut approved by both Republicans and Democrats and please remember very important for all countries &amp; businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.

So last year 37000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27000 and 70000 per year. Nothing is shut down life &amp; the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus with 22 deaths. Think about that!

Mini Mike Bloomberg just “quit” the race for President. I could have told him long ago that he didn’t have what it takes and he would have saved himself a billion dollars the real cost. Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe’s campaign hoping to save face. It won’t work!

So selfish for Elizabeth Warren to stay in the race. She has Zero chance of even coming close to winning but hurts Bernie badly. So much for their wonderful liberal friendship. Will he ever speak to her again? She cost him Massachusetts (and came in third) he shouldn’t!

The Democrat establishment came together and crushed Bernie Sanders AGAIN! Even the fact that Elizabeth Warren stayed in the race was devastating to Bernie and allowed Sleepy Joe to unthinkably win Massachusetts. It was a perfect storm with many good states remaining for Joe!

Mini Mike Bloomberg’s consultants and so-called “advisors”(how did that advice work out? Don’t ask!) are on the “gravy train” and all making a fortune for themselves pushing Mini hard when they knew he never had what it takes. Don’t pay them anymore Mike they led you down....

I would find it hard to believe that failed presidential candidates Tom Steyer or Mini Mike Bloombeg would contribute to the Democrat Party even against me after the way they have been treated - laughed at &amp; mocked. The real politicians ate them up and spit them out!

Tom Steyer who other than Mini Mike Bloomberg spent more dollars for NOTHING than any candidate in history quit the race today proclaiming how thrilled he was to be a part of the the Democrat Clown Show. Go away Tom and save whatever little money you have left!

Democrats are working hard to destroy the name and reputation of Crazy Bernie Sanders and take the nomination away from him!

Sleepy Joe Biden’s victory in the South Carolina Democrat Primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg’s Joke of a campaign. After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates  Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters taking many away!

Mini Mike is getting slammed. His debates were perhaps the worst in presidential debating history. A total phony who disavowed “Stop &amp; Frisk” after swearing by it for years and even recently. He horribly overused it &amp; then dropped when running as a Dem. A total phony!

Word is that Mini Mike Bloomberg performed so poorly in the two debates that he is thinking about dropping out of the Democrat Primary. The fact is he was not true to himself and the public was able to quickly figure him out. Not a good experience for Mini Mike!

Mini Mike is now negotiating both to get on the Democrat Primary debate stage and to have the right to stand on boxes or a lift during the debates. This is sometimes done but really not fair!

Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere just wasting his money but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie something they wouldn’t do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again 2016.

Mini Mike is part of the Fake News. They are all working together. In fact Bloomberg isn’t covering himself (too boring to do) or other Dems. Only Trump. That sounds fair! It’s all the Fake News Media and that’s why nobody believes in them any more.

The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats don’t want justice when pushing the Impeachment Hoax they only want to destabilize the Republican Party so they can do better in the 2020 election &amp; that includes the House &amp; Senate. They are playing with the people by taking it this far!

The Democrats don’t want a Witness Trade because Shifty Schiff the Biden’s the fake Whistleblower(&amp; his lawyer) the second Whistleblower (who vanished after I released the Transcripts) the so-called “informer” &amp; many other Democrat disasters would be a BIG problem for them!

Mini Mike Bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting Democrat rivals. He says that if he loses (he really means when!) in the primaries he will spend money helping whoever the Democrat nominee is. By doing this he figures they won’t hit him as hard....

The Democrats &amp; Shifty Schiff whose presentation to the Senate was loaded with lies and misrepresentations are refusing to state that the Obama Administration withheld aid from many countries including Ukraine Pakistan Philippines Egypt Honduras &amp; Mexico. Witch Hunt!

No matter what you give to the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats it will never be enough!

The Democrat House would not give us lawyers or not one witness but now demand that the Republican Senate produce the witnesses that the House never sought or even asked for? They had their chance but pretended to rush. Most unfair &amp; corrupt hearing in Congressional history!

Hope that all House Republicans will vote against Crazy Nancy Pelosi’s War Powers Resolution. Also remember her “speed &amp; rush” in getting the Impeachment Hoax voted on &amp; done. Well she never sent the Articles to the Senate. Just another Democrat fraud. Presidential Harassment!

PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!

Thank you Elise! https://t.co/Y4Hb0zf5jk

Pelosi doesn’t want to hand over The Articles of Impeachment which were fraudulently produced by corrupt politicians like Shifty Schiff in the first place because after all of these years of investigations and persecution they show no crimes and are a joke and a scam!

Congress &amp; the President should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax when we have so many important matters pending. 196 to ZERO was the Republican House vote &amp; we got 3 Dems. This was not what the Founders had in mind!
